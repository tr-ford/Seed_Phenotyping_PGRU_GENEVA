## Goal: Make a series of correlative tests and statistical tests to determine what 
## treatment provides the most accurate measures compared to hand measurements, also consider time
## This is to determine the cost-benifit of said treatments
## Proposed Task: Use Inter-Class Correlation to identify the reliability of the three raters(treatments).

# Measures the degree of agreement between different raters assessing the same data. We measure interrater reliability when a dataset is being
# assessed by one or more raters. It is important to have good interrater reliability because people are subjective so different ratersâ€™ evaluations 
# naturally differ. Researchers should aim to minimize subjectivity in their study to ensure others can replicate the same results."
